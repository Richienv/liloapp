# Booking System Performance Analysis and Optimization

## Introduction
This document analyzes a performance issue in a booking system deployed on Vercel's Hobby plan. While the system functions correctly on a local development environment, it encounters failures on Vercel, particularly during the booking creation process after payment confirmation. The goal of this research is to identify the root causes of this discrepancy and propose actionable optimizations to resolve the issue without requiring an upgrade to a higher Vercel plan.

## Problem Description
The primary symptom is a consistent failure in creating bookings on Vercel, with errors appearing in the web console approximately 4-6 seconds after payment confirmation. This delay indicates that the process is approaching or exceeding Vercel's 10-second execution limit for serverless functions on the Hobby plan. In contrast, the local environment, which lacks such strict time constraints, completes the process quickly and without errors. Notably, a voucher-related error present in both environments does not prevent booking creation locally, suggesting that the core issue is specific to Vercel's deployment constraints.

## Potential Causes
### Multiple Sequential Database Operations
The booking creation process involves several database operations executed sequentially: inserting bookings, creating payment records, updating bookings with payment group IDs, updating voucher usage, and creating notifications. This sequential execution can accumulate enough latency to exceed the 10-second limit, especially for bulk bookings.

### Inefficient Bulk Booking Creation
When bookings span multiple hours or days, all insertions are processed simultaneously in a single operation. This approach is resource-intensive and time-consuming, increasing the likelihood of timeouts on Vercel.

### Excessive Logging
The codebase includes numerous `console.log` statements, often with large JSON payloads. These logs consume memory and processing time, which can worsen performance in Vercel’s resource-constrained environment.

### Connection Pool Management Issues
Each database operation instantiates a new Supabase client, potentially exhausting the connection pool and introducing latency, particularly under load.

### Cold Start Impacts
Serverless functions on Vercel’s Hobby plan experience cold starts, adding 2-3 seconds of overhead. When combined with database operations, this can push execution times beyond the 10-second limit.

### Notification Overhead
Creating notifications for each booking is performed synchronously, adding unnecessary processing time to the critical path of the function.

### Synchronous Payment Callback Load
The payment callback endpoint handles extensive synchronous tasks, including heavy database operations, which contribute significantly to execution delays.

## Optimization Strategies
### Combining Database Operations
**Solution:** Batch multiple database operations into a single PostgreSQL transaction or use Supabase’s RPC (Remote Procedure Call) to process them server-side, minimizing round trips to the database.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// In app/api/payments/callback/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  console.log(`[${startTime}] Payment callback received`);
  
  try {
    // Use a single RPC call to process all booking-related operations
    const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('process_booking_payment', {
      payment_result: result,
      payment_metadata: metadata
    });
    console.log(`[${Date.now()}] Booking creation completed in ${Date.now() - startTime}ms`);
    if (error) throw error;
    return NextResponse.json(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`[${Date.now()}] Error after ${Date.now() - startTime}ms`, error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Chunking Bulk Bookings
**Solution:** Divide large sets of bookings into smaller batches (e.g., 10 bookings per batch) and process them sequentially to prevent timeouts.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// In payment-service.ts
export async function createBookingAfterPayment(result, metadata) {
  // Split bookings into chunks of 10
  const bookingChunks = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < bookingInserts.length; i += 10) {
    bookingChunks.push(bookingInserts.slice(i, i + 10));
  }
  
  // Process each chunk sequentially
  const newBookings = [];
  for (const chunk of bookingChunks) {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.from('bookings').insert(chunk).select();
    if (error) throw error;
    newBookings.push(...(data || []));
  }
  // Continue with remaining logic...
}
```

### Reducing Logging Overhead
**Solution:** Implement conditional logging to limit verbose output in production environments, reducing resource consumption.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// General logging function
const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const log = (message, data) => {
  if (!isProduction) {
    console.log(message, JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
  } else {
    console.log(message);
  }
};
```

### Reusing Database Connections
**Solution:** Use a singleton pattern for the Supabase client to reuse connections and avoid the overhead of repeated instantiations.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// Singleton Supabase client
let supabaseInstance = null;

export function getSupabaseClient() {
  if (!supabaseInstance) {
    supabaseInstance = createClient();
  }
  return supabaseInstance;
}
```

### Mitigating Cold Starts
**Solution:** Implement a warming strategy, such as scheduled pings, to keep serverless functions active and reduce cold start delays.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// Scheduled task to warm functions
export async function warmFunctions() {
  await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL}/api/payments/callback`, { 
    method: 'HEAD',
    cache: 'no-store'
  });
}
```

### Moving Non-Critical Tasks Asynchronously
**Solution:** Offload non-essential tasks like notification creation to background processes, allowing the main function to complete faster.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// After booking creation
const notificationPromise = createNotifications(newBookings);
// Don't await this promise - let it run in the background

// Return response immediately
return { success: true, bookings: newBookings };
```

### Shifting Heavy Processing to Webhooks
**Solution:** Move booking creation and other heavy operations to a webhook endpoint, keeping the payment callback lightweight and responsive.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// In payments/callback/route.ts - Lightweight callback
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    const { result } = await request.json();
    // Verify payment and return immediately
    return NextResponse.json({ success: true, message: 'Payment received, booking processing initiated' });
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors
  }
}

// In payment-webhook/route.ts - Heavy processing
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // Process payment notification and create bookings here
}
```

## Conclusion
By implementing these optimizations in the following order—first, chunking bulk bookings; second, shifting processing to webhooks; third, optimizing database operations; and finally, reducing logging overhead—the booking creation process can be significantly improved. These changes are designed to ensure the system operates efficiently within the constraints of Vercel’s Hobby plan, specifically its 10-second execution limit. To confirm their effectiveness, it’s critical to test these solutions thoroughly and monitor execution times, ensuring the system remains reliable and performant.
